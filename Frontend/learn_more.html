                    <h2>Why Mental Health Matters?</h2>
                    <p>Mental health is an essential component of overall wellbeing. Taking care of it is just as
                        important as maintaining physical health. A healthy mind not only contributes to emotional
                        balance but also improves productivity, decision-making, and relationships. Prioritizing mental
                        health helps in managing stress, increasing resilience, and fostering a better quality of life.

                        can guide you on whether a hospital visit is necessary, making the process more efficient and
                        convenient. By eliminating travel time, we ensure you can prioritize your mental health making
                        self-care more accessible and stress-free.</p>
