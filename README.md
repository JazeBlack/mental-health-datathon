# Mental Illness Detection using AI/ML techniques.

## Overview
This project aims to provide early detection and classification of potential mental health issues using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models. The system is divided into **two phases**:
- **Phase 1:** Detects whether the user has any mental health issue using Logistic Regression(binary).
- **Phase 2:** If an issue is detected, the system further classifies the specific mental disorder using multi-class classification.

The goal is to raise awareness, provide early warnings, and encourage individuals to seek professional help if necessary.
